<div class = "about">
  <p>During my internship at LakePharma, I was given the opportunity to explore my abilities with graphic design and creation. I was constantly tasked with creating new graphic representations of scientific models, workflows, and other diagrams, as well as coming up with creative ways to illustrate specific concepts. The process would involve several rounds of feedback between the scientists and me. I would use my best judgement own creativity to illustrate the first version of the graphic, and continue to recieve feedback, make adjustments, add and retract as new ideas came in, until a final version was approved.</p>

  <h3>Infographic</h3>
  <br> 
  <ul> 
    <li>-The scientists and marketing team at LakePharma wanted to create an infographic that could let their clients know what considerations they took in when selecting a rodent host.</li>
    <li>-I was given a word document filled with information, and was tasked with organizing the information in a logical and comprehensible way.</li>
    <li>-I looked at other infographic design templates on Adobe Stock to get inspiration, and created my own design to illustrate the information in an intelligble manner.</li>
    <li>-The fourth and final version was released and published through a landing page, which I also created. The company's marketing team then sent out the landing page via email, and had clients download the pdf of the infographic, and express whether they were interested in learning more about the company's services.</li>
    <li>-Overall, the infographic helped the company gain 7 new potential clients.</li>
    <li>-Landing page address: <a href="
    https://info.lakepharma.com/hybridoma-rodent-considerations-infographic" target="_blank">Rodent Considerations Infographic Landing Page</a></li>
