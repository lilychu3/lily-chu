    <p>This past semester, I took Human Computer Interaction. Throughout the course, I worked with a group to conduct several rounds of interviews with various user groups, run through multiple iterations of designs, and create paper, InVision, and coded prototypes. After getting to experience the process of user-centered design for myself, I learned that creativity without the proper preparation is just decoration, and tightly-defined strategy is needed to create the user experience. </p>
