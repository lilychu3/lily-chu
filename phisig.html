<div class = "about">
  <p>After joining Wellesley College's Lecture Society during my first year, I was elected as Webmistress, and still hold this position today. This means I am tasked with maintaining and updating the website. The main functions of the website are to display who the members of the society are, information about applying to the society and details for upcoming events, and promoting past and future lectures. </p>

  <h3>Web Design</h3>
  <br> 
  <ul> 
    <li>-The Webmistress before me had already created the website using bootstrap. When it was passed on to me, I had to figure out how to read the code with limited documentation for assistance.</li>
    <li>-I kept the original bootstrap code that the previous Webmistress had used, but added my own designs and features with HTML and CSS.</li>
    <li>-Now, I focus on maintaining the website and updating the Members page. I am also currently working to further develop the Lecture tab to be more informative, as well as redesign and update the Alumnae Tab.</li>
    <li>-I recently filmed and edited the most recent lecture that our society hosted, and put it up on the Lecture tab.</li>
