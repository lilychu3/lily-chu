<div class = "about">
  <p>After joining Wellesley College's Lecture Society during my first year, I was elected as Webmistress, and still hold this position today. This means I am tasked with maintaining and updating the website. The main functions of the website are to display profiles of our members, information about applying to the society and details for upcoming events, and promoting past and future lectures. </p>

  <h3>Web Design and Development</h3>
  <br> 
  <ul> 
    <li>The Webmistress before me had already created the website using bootstrap. When I inherited the codebase, I had to learn the code structure and build on top of it with limited documentation.</li>
    <li>Now, I focus on maintaining the website and updating the Members page. I am also currently working to further develop the Lecture page to be more informative, as well as redesign and update the Alumnae page.</li>
    <li>I recently filmed and edited the most recent lecture that our society hosted, and added it to the Lecture page.</li>
