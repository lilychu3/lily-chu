  <h3>"The Conjuring 2" Stop Motion Animation</h3>
  <br> 
  <ul> 
    <li>-I created this project for my Moving Image Studio Class (ARTS 260). The assignment was to simply create a stop motion animation.</li>
    <li>-I had recently seen "It: Chapter Two", and am already a huge fan of horror movies and the horror genre. I thought back to one of my favorite horror jump scares, which is from "The Conjuring 2".</li>
    <li>-I story boarded the major shots I wanted to create.</li>
    <li>-I then printed out every other frame of the scene I was recreating, and rotoscoped it. </li>
    <li>-I used Adobe Premiere Pro to put together the sequence of illustrations I created, and timed it with the original audio</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Psychology of Fear</h3>
  <br> 
  <ul> 
    <li>-I created this project for my Intermediate Video Production Class (ARTS 264). The assignment was to create an appropriation video, meaning we were tasked with appropriating footage or images from any other source and reusing it to produce something different.</li>
    <li>-After my stop motion animation, I wanted to further experiment with the genre of horror, and found inspiration in a scene from "American Horror Story: Apocalypse."</li>
    <li>-I gathered footage from some of my favorite horror movies, and compiled it to create a video titled "The Psychology of Fear".</li>
    <li>-The purpose of the video is to explain why humans find pleasure in watching horror films. </li>
    <li>-I used Adobe Premiere Pro to put together the footage I compiled, as well as apply various video effects to create the "black and white silent film" styling.</li>
